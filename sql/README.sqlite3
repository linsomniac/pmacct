To create the database and the table you have to execute the following scripts.
Remember that SQLite - unlike MySQL and PostgreSQL - does not endorse concepts
of authentication (username and password couple) and permissions which are
embedded into the filesystem instead. The database filename '/tmp/pmacct.db'
is just a trivial example: you are free to build the database wherever fits
better for you on the system (e.g., to follow a partitioning scheme, impose 
specific permissions, etc.). 

- To create v1 tables:
shell> sqlite3 /tmp/pmacct.db < pmacct-create-table.sqlite3

Data will be available in 'acct' table of '/tmp/pmacct.db' DB.

- To create v2 tables:
shell> sqlite3 /tmp/pmacct.db < pmacct-create-table_v2.sqlite3

Data will be available in 'acct_v2' table of '/tmp/pmacct.db' DB.

- To create v3 tables:
shell> sqlite3 /tmp/pmacct.db < pmacct-create-table_v3.sqlite3

Data will be available in 'acct_v3' table of '/tmp/pmacct.db' DB.

- To create v4 tables:
shell> sqlite3 /tmp/pmacct.db < pmacct-create-table_v4.sqlite3

Data will be available in 'acct_v4' table of '/tmp/pmacct.db' DB.

- To create v5 tables:
shell> sqlite3 /tmp/pmacct.db < pmacct-create-table_v5.sqlite3

Data will be available in 'acct_v5' table of '/tmp/pmacct.db' DB.

- To create v6 tables:
shell> sqlite3 /tmp/pmacct.db < pmacct-create-table_v6.sqlite3

- To create v7 tables:
shell> sqlite3 /tmp/pmacct.db < pmacct-create-table_v7.sqlite3

Data will be available in 'acct_v6' table of '/tmp/pmacct.db' DB.

- To understand difference between v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6 and v7 tables:
  - Do you need TCP flags ? Then you have to use v7.
  - Do you need both IP addresses and AS numbers in the same table ? Then you have to use v6.
  - Do you need packet classification ? Then you have to use v5.
  - Do you need flows (other than packets) accounting ? Then you have to use v4.
  - Do you need ToS/DSCP field (QoS) accounting ? Then you have to use v3.
  - Do you need agent ID for distributed accounting and packet tagging ? Then you have to use v2. 
  - Do you need VLAN traffic accounting ? Then you have to use v2.
  - If all of the above points sound useless, then use v1.

NOTE: mind to specify EVERYTIME which SQL table version you
intend to adhere to by using either of the following rules:

commandline:    -v [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 ]
configuration:  sql_table_version: [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 ]
