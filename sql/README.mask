The 'mask_src' and 'mask_dst' fields.
Such fields are being introduced to support source and destination IP prefix masks.
Values are grasped as configured in [nf|sf|pm|u]acctd_net directive: NetFlow/sFlow
protocols, BGP, Network files (networks_file) or static (networks_mask) being valid
data sources. The guidelines below (typically in MySQL format) are to add such
primitives to the SQL schema:

* mask_src field:
  - "mask_src INT(1) UNSIGNED NOT NULL," to declare the field itself
  - "PRIMARY KEY (..., mask_src, ...)" to put it in the primary key 

* mask_dst field:
  - "mask_dst INT(1) UNSIGNED NOT NULL," to declare the field itself
  - "PRIMARY KEY (..., mask_dst, ...)" to put it in the primary key 

The primitive is not declared as part of any default table version; yet will not fail
version checks which are enabled when 'sql_optimize_clauses' feature is disabled.
