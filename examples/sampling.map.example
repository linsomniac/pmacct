! Sampling map -- given at least a router IP, returns a sampling rate
!
! File syntax is key-based. Position of keys inside the same row (rule) is not
! relevant; Spaces are not allowed (ie. 'id = 1' is not valid). The first full
! match wins (like in firewall rules). Negative values mean negations (ie. match
! data NOT entering interface 2: 'in=-2'); 'id' and 'ip' keys don't support
! negative values.
!
! nfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, out
!
! sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, out
!
! list of currently supported keys follows:
!
! 'id'			sampling rate assigned to a matching packet, flow or sample.
!			The result is used to renormalize packet and bytes count if
!			either of sfacctd_renormalize or nfacctd_renormalize config
!			directive is set to true.
! 'ip'			In nfacctd this is compared against the source IP address of
!			the device which is originating NetFlow packets; in sfacctd
!			this is compared against the AgentId field of received sFlow
!			samples.
! 'in'  		Input interface 
! 'out' 		Output interface 
!

! Examples:
!
id=1024		ip=192.168.1.1
id=2048		ip=192.168.2.1 	in=5
id=4096		ip=192.168.3.1 	out=3
