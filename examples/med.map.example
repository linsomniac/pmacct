! BGP source MED (Multi Exit Discriminator) map 
!
! File syntax is key-based. Read full syntax rules in 'pretag.map.example' in
! this same directory.
!
! nfacctd, sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, bgp_nexthop, src_mac.
!
! list of currently supported keys follow:
!
! 'id'			ID value to assign to a matching packet or flow. Other
!			than hard-coded MED values this field accepts also the
!			'bgp' keyword which triggers a BGP lookup and returns
!			its result: useful to handle exceptions.
! 'ip'                  In nfacctd it's compared against the source IP address
!                       of the device which is originating NetFlow packets; in
!                       sfacctd this is compared against the AgentId field of
!                       received sFlow samples.
! 'in'                  Input interface.
! 'bgp_nexthop'         BGP next-hop of the flow source IP address (RPF-like).
!                       This value is compared against the corresponding BGP
!                       RIB of the exporting device.
! 'peer_dst_as'         First AS hop within the AS-PATH of the source IP address
!                       (RPF-like). This value is compared against the BGP RIB
!                       of the exporting device (see 'bgp_daemon' configuration
!                       directive).
! 'src_mac'             Source MAC address of the flow. Requires NetFlow v9 or
!                       sFlow.
!
! A few examples follow.
