! nfacctd, sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, bgp_nexthop, src_mac.
!
! list of currently supported keys follow:
!
! 'id'			ID value to assign to a matching packet or flow. Other than AS
!			numbers, this field accepts also the 'bgp' keyword which triggers
!			a BGP lookup and returns its result: useful to handle exceptions.
! 'ip'			IP address of the device which is originating sFlow or NetFlow
!			datagrams (router, probe, etc.)
! 'in'  		Input interface 
! 'bgp_nexthop'		BGP next-hop of the flow source IP address (RPF-like). This value
!			is compared against the BGP RIB of the device originating the sFlow
!			or NetFlow datagram (see 'nfacctd_bgp' directive).
! 'peer_dst_as'		First AS hop within the AS-PATH of the source IP address (RPF-like).
!			This value is compared against the BGP RIB of the device originating
!			the sFlow or NetFlow datagram (see 'nfacctd_bgp' directive). 
! 'src_mac'		Source MAC address of the flow. Requires NetFlow v9 or sFlow as
!			NetFlow v5 lacks of such support.
!
! A few examples follow.
