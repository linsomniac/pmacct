! PE router ifIndex to BGP/MPLS VPN RD map
!
! File syntax is key-based. Read full syntax rules in 'pretag.map.example' in
! this same directory.
!
! nfacctd, sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, out.
!
! list of currently supported keys follow:
!
! 'id'			IPv4 address or router ID of the BGP peer
! 'ip'                  In nfacctd it's compared against the source IP address
!                       of the device which is originating NetFlow packets; in
!                       sfacctd this is compared against the AgentId field of
!                       received sFlow samples.
! 'in'                  Input interface
! 'out'                 Output interface
!
! A couple of straightforward examples follow.  
!
! Maps input interface 100 of router 192.168.1.1 to RD 0:65512:1 - ie.
! a BGP/MPLS VPN Route Distinguisher encoded as type #0 according to
! to rfc4659: <2-bytes ASN>:<value> . Type #2 is equivalent to type #0
! except it supports 4-bytes ASN encoding.
!
id=0:65512:1		ip=192.168.1.1		in=100
!
! Maps input interface 100 of router 192.168.1.1 to RD 1:192.168.1.1:1
! ie. a BGP/MPLS VPN Route Distinguisher encoded as type #1 according 
! to rfc4659: <IPv4 Address>:<value>
!
id=1:192.168.1.1:1	ip=192.168.1.1          in=100
