! nfacctd, sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, bgp_nexthop, src_mac.
!
! list of currently supported keys follow:
!
! 'id'			ID value to assign to a matching packet or flow
! 'ip'			IP address of the device which is originating sFlow or NetFlow
!			datagrams (router, probe, etc.)
! 'in'  		Input interface 
! 'bgp_nexthop'		BGP next-hop of the flow source IP address. This value is compared
!			against the BGP RIB of the device originating the sFlow or NetFlow
!			datagram (see 'nfacctd_bgp' directive).
! 'src_mac'		Source MAC address of the flow. Requires NetFlow v9 or sFlow as
!			NetFlow v5 lacks of such support.
!
! A few examples follow.
!
! Private peering with AS12345 on router with IP address 192.168.2.1, SNMP ifIndex 4 
!
id=12345	ip=192.168.2.1	in=7

! A way to model a public internet exchange - in case MAC addresses are not available,
! ie. NetFlow v5. The catch-all entry at the end can be the AS number of the exchange.
! Note that by using 'bgp_nexthop' for this purpose constitutes only an educated guess.
! 
id=34567	ip=192.168.1.1 	in=7	bgp_nexthop=1.2.3.4.5
id=45678	ip=192.168.1.1 	in=7	bgp_nexthop=1.2.3.4.6
id=56789	ip=192.168.1.1 	in=7

! A way to model a public internet exchange - in case MAC addresses are available. The
! method is exact and hence doesn't require a catch-all entry at the end.
! 
id=34567        ip=192.168.1.1  in=7    src_mac=00:01:02:03:04:05
id=45678        ip=192.168.1.1  in=7    src_mac=00:01:02:03:04:06
