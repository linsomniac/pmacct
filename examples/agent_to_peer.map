! NetFlow/sFlow agent to BGP peer map
!
! File syntax is key-based. Read full syntax rules in 'pretag.map.example' in this same
! directory.
!
! nfacctd, sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip.
!
! list of currently supported keys follow:
!
! 'id'			IP address of the BGP peer
! 'ip'			IP address of the sFlow/NetFlow agent
!
! A couple of straightforward examples follow.  
!
id=1.2.3.4	ip=2.3.4.5
!
! The following comes handy when compiling pmacct for IPv6; BGP peers
! are always IPv4 addresses. Whereas remote sFlow or NetFlow agents are
! likely to be intended as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, if nfacctd_ip is
! not specified.
!
! id=3.4.5.6	ip=::ffff:4.5.6.7
