TOOLS DESCRIPTION.

pmacctd		libpcap-based accounting daemon; it captures packets from an
		interface it is bound to. Statistics can be printed to stdout,
		stored in memory tables or a PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite/Berkeley
		DB(*) database, exported via NetFlow, IPFIX or sFlow protocols.
nfacctd		NetFlow accounting daemon; it listens for NetFlow packets
		v1/v5/v7/v8/v9 and IPFIX on one or more interfaces (IPv4 and
		IPv6); statistics can be printed to stdout, stored in memory
		tables or a PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite/BerkeleyDB(*) database,
		replicated to other collectors.
sfacctd         sFlow accounting daemon; it listens for sFlow packets v2,
                v4 and v5 on one or more interfaces (both IPv4 and IPv6);
                statistics can be printed to stdout, stored in memory tables
                or a PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite/BerkeleyDB(*) database, replicated
		to other collectors.
uacctd		Linux Netlink ULOG accounting daemon; it captures packets by
		leveraging a ULOG multicast group - and works only on Linux;
		Statistics can be printed to stdout, stored in memory tables
		or a PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite/BerkeleyDB(*) database, exported
		via NetFlow, IPFIX or sFlow protocols.
pmacct  	commandline pmacct client; used to retrieve data from a
		memory plugin; it can execute both partial and full data
		retrieval. Output is either formatted or 'counters-only',
		suitable for data injection in tools like MRTG, RRDtool,
		Gnuplot or SNMP server among the others.
pmmyplay	pmacct MySQL logfile player; it plays logfiles previously
		generated by a MySQL plugin.
pmpgplay	pmacct PgSQL logfile player; it plays logfiles previously
		generated by a PostgreSQL plugin.

(*) using BerkeleyDB SQLite API
