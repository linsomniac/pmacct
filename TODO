This software is currently under strong development, i'll try to
reach a good and stable stage as soon as possible; the project
has been started for practical reasons and i'm working on it,
enthusiastically, mostly in my spare time. Any comment, idea,
and any other kind of help, contribution or support is warmly
welcome. Listed below are only few ideas to be reached as soon
as possible.
Currently, this software has to be considered in a development
stage, so take care when using it in a production environment.
If you find any bug, problem or misbehaviour don't hesitate to
contact me.
I'm currently not able to provide any kind of mission critical
support, mainly for lack of resources. However, you may find
useful the 'pmacct-discussion' mailing-list for getting in
touch with us. Find details about it onto the project homepage. 
If you have resources or proposals, feel free to contact me
(email is in AUTHORS document); i'll be happy to read about
them; i'll answer you as soon as possible.
 
 ! sFlow: lacks of support for common architectures such as 
   POS, ATM and F-Relay, mainly because of missing hardware
   to test them. Moreover, the actual PPP support lacks of
   an extensive testing. Requests, feedbacks and support 
   are welcome. 
 + improvements to the plugins architecture; more advanced
   concepts will be greatly useful: they would permit some
   advanced feature such as hotswap of old plugins without
   the need to restart the daemon and should ease/encourage
   the development of new plugins. 
 + find new and interesting backends to support out there.
   Writing to files is an already inflated method currently
   supported by a number of applications. 

Cheers,
Paolo
